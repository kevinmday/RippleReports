<h1>The Gatsby President and the Math of Moral Decay</h1>
<h2>America’s soul is eroding at a calculable rate, and the man in the gold room keeps hosting parties.</h2>
<p class="byline">By Kevin Day</p>

<p>Some ironies are so grotesque they can’t even be called irony anymore—they’re diagnosis. Donald Trump, hosting a “Great Gatsby”-themed gala while the nation’s poor brace for a government shutdown, isn’t a metaphor. It’s a measurement of moral entropy in real time.</p>

<p>Trump has always been the anti-Gatsby: no yearning, no lost love—just appetite. Gatsby reached for the green light; Trump flicks it on and sells tickets. America, watching, mistakes the glow for glory.</p>

<p>RippleTruth analysis puts our national coherence at <strong>FILS = 0.87</strong> (strong moral intent) and <strong>TTCF = 0.94</strong> (near-total chaos). That math tells a simple truth: our collective intention is collapsing under the weight of its own noise.</p>

<div class="math">
I<sub>society</sub>(t) = I<sub>0</sub> · e<sup>−λ<sub>chaos</sub>t</sup>  where λ<sub>chaos</sub> ≈ 0.94
</div>

<p>That’s the decay curve of a country drunk on grievance and delusion. Every Mar-a-Lago gala accelerates the half-life of American empathy. Each tweet, each cheap applause line, widens the moral gap between what we once were and what we tolerate now.</p>

<p>In physics, energy lost to friction becomes heat. In intention theory, <em>meaning lost to greed becomes chaos</em>. You can calculate it:</p>

<div class="math">
M = 1 / (1 + W × C)
</div>

<p>Here, <strong>M</strong> is moral coherence, <strong>W</strong> is wealth concentration, and <strong>C</strong> is chaos. When both rise—as they have under Trump—the denominator grows, and the nation’s moral temperature falls toward zero. No prayer breakfast can reverse that curve until the equation itself is rewritten.</p>

“They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money...” —F. Scott Fitzgerald
</div>

<p>The original Gatsby ended face-down in a swimming pool. America’s version might end in a ballroom, champagne still fizzing, the orchestra still playing while the lights flicker out. Trump isn’t Gatsby’s ghost—he’s the arithmetic of what happens when we celebrate our own collapse.</p>

<p>And somewhere outside those gilded gates, the hungry are still waiting for dinner that will never come—because the president took the tablecloth and turned it into a costume.</p>
