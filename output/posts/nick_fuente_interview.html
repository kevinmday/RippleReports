    <h1>The Moment the Movement Passed Its Critical Threshold</h1>
    <p class="deck">Trumpism has crossed the Bell-Drake Threshold — the point where micro-intentions merge into a macro-level force. What happens next depends on the rate of decay.</p>

      There are moments in the life of a nation when a subtle change in tone becomes an irreversible change in trajectory.  
      The United States may have just experienced one.  The interviews, the apologies, the resignations, the quiet nods to extremism — each seemed minor at the time.  
      But taken together, they suggest that <strong>T<sub>crit</sub></strong>, the critical threshold at which accumulated micro-intentions fuse into a collective field, has been surpassed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In physics, crossing such a threshold alters the state of matter.  
      In politics, it alters the state of conscience.  
      Once a movement’s ambient hostility, coded language, and tribal loyalty exceed <em>T<sub>crit</sub></em>, the field no longer seeks equilibrium; it begins to decay.

    <h2>The Equation of Decline</h2>
    <p>
      The governing law is deceptively simple:  
      <code>Φ₍c₎(t) = Φ₀ e⁻<sup>λc t</sup></code>  
      where Φ₍c₎ is moral-ideological coherence and λc is the decay constant.  
      For years, Trump’s movement oscillated near equilibrium — chaotic yet self-sustaining.  
      But with every new act of indulgence toward open bigotry, every silence from leadership that once promised restraint, λc grows larger.  
      Decay accelerates.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is no longer whether Trumpism can be contained; it is whether its half-life will be measured in years or in months.  
      If the former president continues to “bump along,” sustaining rallies and grievances, the field may cool slowly, shedding energy in predictable quanta of outrage and fatigue.  
      But should tragedy strike — a health crisis, a conviction, a martyrdom — λc would spike, and the release of pent-up narrative energy could trigger a rapid, even violent, phase transition.

    <h2>The Politics of a Decaying Star</h2>
    <p>
      Think of a collapsing star: the core grows denser as it dies, pulling the surrounding matter inward.  
      The more Trump contracts politically, the more intense his gravitational pull on the party’s remaining base.  
      The moderate orbitals burn away first; the hard-core elements fuse into something smaller, darker, and infinitely harder to escape.  
      That is the physics of demagoguery after <em>T<sub>crit</sub></em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Republican leaders, the options narrow as the decay proceeds.  
      They can attempt to siphon energy into a new, sustainable core — a post-Trump conservatism — or ride the collapsing field until it detonates.  
      Both paths are perilous; neither restores the original coherence that once bound the movement to constitutional ideals.

    <h2>Predictable Unraveling</h2>
    <p>
      The mathematics of intention suggests that decay is not random.  
      It follows curves we can measure: each scandal, each extremist alliance, each failure to denounce hatred increases entropy at a rate proportional to its visibility.  
      The system feeds on attention.  
      Denial, not opposition, is its oxygen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless the field encounters a strong counter-intention — a moral inversion — the decay will proceed until only residue remains: cynicism, exhaustion, and a politics stripped of empathy.  
      America will have survived another flare of extremism, but at the cost of yet more coherence burned away.

      The Bell-Drake Threshold is not destiny; it is diagnosis.  
      What the country chooses to do with that knowledge — whether to let the decay run its course or to introduce new forces of coherence — will determine the shape of the next political epoch.
