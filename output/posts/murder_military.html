  <h1>The Next Court-Martial Will Be for Murder — Not War</h1>
  <div class="deck">
    As the United States carries out lethal drug-interdiction strikes without a declared war or public rules of engagement, military law still calls such killings what they are.
  </div>
  <div class="byline">By Kevin Day<br>November 7, 2025</div>

  <p>The United States Navy is killing people again — not in a war, not under any congressional authorization, and not according to any publicly known rules of engagement. The targets are alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean and the Pacific. The weapons are drones and ship-mounted missiles. The orders come wrapped in the elastic language of “counter-narcotics operations.” And the law, for now, is silent.</p>

  <p>Silence will not last.</p>

  <p>Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, murder is still murder. Article 118 makes no exemption for acts committed at sea when no armed conflict exists. The Pentagon’s own directives require a declared operational framework before lethal force may be used. None has been presented to Congress or to the American people. What we have instead is a bureaucratic sleight of hand: the re-branding of drug enforcement as war.</p>

  <p>If that phrase sounds familiar, it should. For half a century Washington has waged a “War on Drugs” that somehow never required a declaration of war. But now that metaphor has turned literal. Vessels have been destroyed and crews killed outright without arrest or trial. These are not combatants; they are suspects. In any rule-of-law nation, suspects are not executed by missile.</p>

  <p>The officers and sailors carrying out these orders deserve clarity and protection. They are serving a country that has placed them in an impossible legal position — told to fight an enemy that Congress never named and to use force that international law forbids. When the political tide changes, as it always does, they will be left alone with the paperwork and the guilt. History suggests what comes next: investigations, tribunals, and eventually courts-martial.</p>

  <p>Those proceedings may not happen under this administration. They may begin under the next. But they will happen. Because in the end, the American military answers not to a man or a party but to a Constitution — one that reserves to Congress the power to declare war and to the courts the power to judge criminal acts. No executive order can erase that foundation.</p>

  <p>The United States cannot condemn authoritarian regimes for extrajudicial killings while conducting its own at sea. Our legitimacy, abroad and at home, depends on the difference between force and murder — between lawful combat and assassination. To preserve that difference, someone will have to say no, even to the Commander-in-Chief. Someone will have to insist that the next strike order be lawful before it is lethal.</p>

  <p>And if no one does, the reckoning will come later, in a courtroom decorated not with medals, but with the evidence of a nation that forgot its own laws.</p>
