    <h1>The Grand Conspiracy That Isn’t</h1>
    <h2>When retribution masquerades as justice, truth itself becomes collateral damage.</h2>

    <p>
      There’s a new “grand conspiracy” circulating in Trump-aligned circles — a sweeping claim that Barack Obama, John Brennan, and a shadowy cabal of intelligence operatives conspired to destroy Donald Trump. The theory, recently given oxygen by a federal prosecutor in South Florida, has quickly morphed from online fantasy into quasi-official inquiry. Yet beneath the rhetoric lies a glaring absence of both logic and truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s start with what we know. The Justice Department has confirmed that <em>Jason A. Reding Quiñones</em>, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, has issued more than two dozen subpoenas targeting figures involved in the 2016 Russia investigation. Among them: James Clapper, Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page — familiar names from a saga already exhaustively investigated, twice, and found to lack criminal basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two prior reviews — one by the Department’s inspector general, another by special counsel John Durham — found <strong>no evidence of wrongdoing</strong> by Brennan or others who authored the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian interference. Those facts matter. What’s happening now is not the discovery of new evidence but the recycling of discredited narratives for political theater.
    </p>

    <p>
      The logic flaw here is foundational: if an act took place in Washington, D.C., why is it being prosecuted in Florida — except that Florida happens to be where Mar-a-Lago sits? The jurisdictional leap is as thin as the evidence itself. Using a venue tied to Trump’s private residence isn’t a sign of sound prosecutorial strategy; it’s an unmistakable signal of <em>intention</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the intention is not justice. It’s vengeance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the lexicon of RippleTruth’s intention metrics, this marks a dangerous phase drift: when the energy of retribution overwhelms the coherence of evidence. The <strong>Future Intention Likelihood Scale (FILS)</strong> reading for rule-of-law decay is high — roughly 0.78 — meaning that political will, not legal reasoning, is driving events.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ve seen this movie before. During his first term, Mr. Trump repeatedly demanded criminal investigations into his critics — James Comey, Hillary Clinton, even reporters. Each time, the institutions held, barely. Now, with loyalists embedded deeper within the Department, the same playbook is being revived — only this time, the lines between political loyalty and lawful authority are vanishing entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      What’s most corrosive is the public confusion this breeds. Each subpoena, each whisper of an “Obama plot,” doesn’t need to yield a conviction to succeed. It simply needs to sustain the illusion that Trump’s enemies are guilty of something — anything. The tactic weaponizes the appearance of justice to hollow out its substance.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Justice is coming,” tweeted one Trump-aligned activist last week. He’s right about one thing: something is indeed coming. But it’s not justice. It’s the continued erosion of our shared reality — one investigation at a time.
