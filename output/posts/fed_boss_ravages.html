      <p>When the CEO of <em>The Federalist</em>—one of the most loyal Trump media citadels—calls the president “weak and rudderless,” it’s not mere gossip. It’s a signal flare fired from within the fortress. For years, Sean Davis’s outlet served as the ideological amplifier of Trump’s populist nationalism. His rebuke marks the first visible crack in a movement that once prided itself on unflinching unity.</p>

      <p>The criticism wasn’t policy-nuanced. It was existential: <strong>“Republicans have no accomplishments, no plans, and no vision.”</strong> In those words lies the recognition that Trumpism has run out of future tense. Its energy—once rooted in grievance and defiance—now decays into the kind of political entropy that Intention Theory would describe as a <strong>collapse of coherent purpose fields</strong>.</p>

      <p>Trump’s response, true to form, was to double down on illusion—claiming Thanksgiving dinner would be cheaper, while dismissing “affordability” concerns as unworthy of presidential attention. The gesture betrays the same FILS decay curve seen before major inflection points: the moment when rhetoric can no longer mask real-world pressure.</p>

      <p>But Davis’s critique also hints at survival instinct. His attack, laced with profanity and self-defense, wasn’t about morality—it was about viability. By urging a “course correction,” he’s trying to preserve what remains of a brand that can’t afford to appear delusional in a collapsing economy. The field of intention within MAGA media is no longer synchronous; it’s oscillating between loyalty and fear.</p>

      <p>The political physics are clear. When a movement’s internal communicators begin firing at the source, <strong>UCIP (Unified Cosmic Intention Postulate)</strong> models predict an approaching threshold—what I’ve previously called the <strong>Bell-Drake threshold</strong>—where cumulative micro-level dissonances become a macro-level break. That break, once crossed, rarely reverses.</p>

      <p>Trumpism, once an accelerating wave, may now be approaching its <strong>T<sub>crit</sub></strong>—the critical threshold where amplification gives way to fragmentation. Davis’s outburst isn’t rebellion; it’s pre-emptive distancing. In the language of power, that’s the sound of escape velocity.</p>
