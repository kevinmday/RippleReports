thesis: 'In the bottom of the ninth inning, Blue Jays third baseman Addison Barger
  hit what many fans at the Rogers Centre thought was an inside-the-park home run
  to left-center field. It was a clutch piece of hitting considering his team was
  trailing 3-1 and there was already a man on first with no outs. Unfortunately for
  the Blue Jays, the umpires determined that it was a lodge ball. As a result, it
  was a ground-rule double.
